<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm currently in the process of teaching myself how to code. I'm a quick study and as proof I'm hosting this portfolio website on 05/05/2023. I currently work as an Advanced Repair Agent for Geek Squad and want to finally pursue a career in programming. Once I achieve this and can quit my current job, I will update this portfolio. The progress of my journey will be recorded here, as well, so the speed of my progress is undisputed.</p>

<p>I'm currently teaching myself fullstack web development, but I'm using that as a stepping stone towards quitting my current job for one as a developer. I'm also interested in iOS/Android app development, game development, and cybersecurity.</p>
